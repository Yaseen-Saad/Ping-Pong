# Fancy Ping Pong 

A ping pong game with AI for a more relaxed gameplay experience. Control your paddle via the arrow keys, score 5 points to win, and watch out for random power-ups (some help you, some help the AI!).

## Features

- **Starfield Background**: Animated stars for a sci-fi feel.  
- **Collision Particles**: Cool visual bursts when ball hits paddles.  
- **Random Power-Ups**: Enlarge your paddle or reverse your controls.  
- **Single-File Setup**: All HTML, CSS, and JS in one placeâ€”no dependencies.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.  
3. Select a difficulty from the start menu.  
4. Press **Arrow Up** or **Arrow Down** to move your paddle.  

## Gameplay Tips

- Keep an eye on the **yellow power-up**.  
- If you collect it first, you might get a larger paddle or slow down the AI.  
- If the AI grabs it, your paddle might shrink or your controls reverse for a while!
